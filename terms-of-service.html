          <h2>1. Acceptance of Terms</h2>
          <p>
            By accessing and using the VoltGuard website and services, you
            accept and agree to be bound by the terms and provisions of this
            agreement. If you do not agree to abide by the above, please do not
            use this service.
          </p>

          <h2>2. Services Description</h2>
          <p>
            VoltGuard provides professional electrical engineering and
            contracting services. All services are subject to availability and
            may vary based on location, project scope, and other factors.
          </p>

          <h2>3. Estimates and Pricing</h2>
          <p>
            We provide estimates for projects. Estimates are based on
            information provided at the time of consultation and may change due
            to site conditions, scope changes, unforeseen complications,
            material price fluctuations, and other factors. Final pricing will
            be confirmed in writing before work begins. All prices are in U.S.
            dollars unless otherwise stated.
          </p>

          <h2>4. Payment Terms</h2>
          <p>
            Payment terms will be specified in your project contract. Generally:
            a deposit may be required to secure your project start date;
            progress payments may be required at various stages; final payment
            is due upon completion and acceptance of work. We accept cash,
            check, and major credit cards. Late payments may be subject to
            interest charges as specified in your contract.
          </p>

          <h2>5. Project Timeline</h2>
          <p>
            We strive to complete projects within estimated timeframes. However,
            timelines are estimates and may be affected by weather, material
            availability, permit processing, unforeseen complications, and scope
            changes. We will communicate significant delays promptly and work to
            minimize inconvenience.
          </p>

          <h2>6. Warranties</h2>
          <p>
            We provide warranties on workmanship and materials as specified in
            your project contract. Warranties typically cover workmanship
            defects for a specified period, manufacturer warranties on materials
            and fixtures, and compliance with building codes. Warranty claims
            must be made in writing within the warranty period. Normal wear and
            tear, damage from misuse, or modifications made by others are not
            covered.
          </p>

          <h2>7. Client Responsibilities</h2>
          <p>
            Clients are responsible for providing accurate project information,
            obtaining necessary permits (if not handled by us), ensuring access
            to the work area, making timely decisions, protecting personal
            belongings, and making payments on schedule.
          </p>

          <h2>8. Limitation of Liability</h2>
          <p>
            To the maximum extent permitted by law, VoltGuard's liability for
            claims arising from our services is limited to the total amount paid
            for the specific project giving rise to the claim. We are not liable
            for indirect, incidental, or consequential damages, loss of use, or
            delays beyond our control.
          </p>

          <h2>9. Dispute Resolution</h2>
          <p>
            We encourage open communication to resolve disputes amicably. If
            unresolved, we will work in good faith to find a mutually acceptable
            solution, may recommend mediation, and any legal proceedings shall
            be conducted in the jurisdiction of the registered office of the
            Website Operator.
          </p>
